# [Fabric] Omen Craft
Official Change &amp; Issue Tracking for Omen Craft

## Welcome to version 1.x.y of Omen Craft! We're thrilled to continue developing this and learning from our mistakes. Thank you so much for your patience and ideas.

* Dashloader was added back to the pack as a trial. This should help with startup times and future releases should help reduce memory consumption. We're watching closely with the releases provided by the author. Note - this mod does conflict with Enhanced Block Entities and there might be some wacky texture issues. We've found that in a lot of cases playing around with the settings in MoreCulling can remove some of these - specifically unticking/unchecking the Block Entity Culling option. 

* More critters and friends should be rolling about too on your worlds.

* Prefab inclusion should allow you to have an established house on joining - hopefully providing a bit more of a fun experience than just dying immediately on your first night.

* Adding a few QOL improvements to help players understand advancements, qualities of their advancements, and better view into usage and durability of tools, weapons and armors. We also exchanged a couple of mods to help keep the original post-vanilla feel. We also provided more storage options provided by Traveler's Backpacks, and glass items via Glassential. 

## If you are planning on creating a server

* I recommend 8 - 12GB (Gigabytes) of RAM - This pack has been tested with 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16gb - and while it will run on 6gb, it's to be more safe. 
* I also recommend running with [Aikar's flags](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags) 

_"Everything Changes, but nothing is truly lost"_

* Our modpack offers an experience similar to your standard vanilla experience, but of course with built in shader support from Iris + Sodium mods. 
We have new dungeons, bosses, creatures, animals, and biomes in each dimension from mods like When Dungeons Arise! and YUNG's series of Better Structures. 

* AdentureZ and Voidz keep the endgame content coming with the new bosses, and mobs they provide, allowing you to progress beyond what you thought was possible. 

* Nullscape, Incdendium, Better End, and Better Nether make sure that you'll never get bored in the other dimensions, providing you with a unique experience each time you load into one of the dimensions. 
Our aim is to provide players with an excellent almost "first breath" feeling when they encounter some of the new threats. And you as the player will be ready to handle these with some of the new weapons, ores, and enchantments provided - all within that same vanilla feel you've come to know and love from minecraft. 

* The Graveyard promises to bring some spooky afterlife and undead works - nightmares, ghouls, revenants - you'll be amazed at the haunts you can conjure whether you're on the surface, or below. 

* With mods like Luck Perms - server management should be easy - and you'll be able to manage your claims, chunks, and players in style. Stylized Chat, Stylized Player List, and Banhammer allow for easy chat notifications, emotes/mark down, and useful reporting features. Moderation made simple, and that's what we aim for - plus with essential commands and FTB's suite of chunk claiming, players on your server will be provided with an easy management system to keep themselves from being griefed, and allowing better teamwork during exploration. 

* And where would we be without discussing mods like Adorn? With plenty of new decorations, furniture options, and yes - a surplus of cooking ingredients thanks to Croptopia - you'll spend plenty of time decorating, redecorating, and research new ways to eat food.  
 
* Explore the world with a bit more ease along the treacherous paths created by Yung's Bridges - and explore the underground villages provided by Stoneholm Underground villages. New villager professions, and even self-guarding villagers can help make your villages seem more secure in this dangerous world. This doesn't even mention the new structures, and dungeons that you'll be forced to encounter, explore, and plunder. With mage towers, windmills, and massive explorations underground, the player will find themselves lost in a sea of monumental structures. 

* And did we mention with changes to fishing and ocean life, you'll have a far more rewarding time in a boat? Encounter sharks, and various other aquatic lifeforms - be drawn in by the alluring luck-based aura of glow squids and watch out for massive shark fossils. With Hopo's better monuments, ruined portals, and mineshafts - the underwater world will be just as treacherous as ever.

* Part of the work on this pack was inspired to be just a simple, easy to understand extension to the vanilla game. 

* As this is my first modpack, I've probably gone a bit overboard with adding so many different mods and losing a more specific focus, but I'm hoping to learn more over time. 

* Can't really say we've done it right, but hey, at least we tried right?

### Now we have a lot of credits to roll out for the mod authors that worked hard on their code and artwork, as follows:
