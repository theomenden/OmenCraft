# Omen Craft 0.11.14

## [Performance]
Managed to get loading into the pack down to ~8GB client side
More improvements coming, but it's not perfect yet. 
Our goal is to reduce consumption further - that being said, in  the chase for ultimate optimization we are keeping in mind that
the sheer quantity of mods will make this difficult. 
Expect hotfixes and patches (these should NOT effect world gen, so clients should be safe to update)
