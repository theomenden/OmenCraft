# 0.11.22 - The fast fix update

- Many mods have been breaking recently, but this update should have the most stable versions of them currently available. 
- Minor configuration fixes and defaults have been provided as well, but of course, change these as needed.
- As per usual, recommended RAM is going to be 8GB+ if you're playing on a dedicated server, 14+ gb if you're building your own world.
- Alloy forgery _should_ work as expected now.
